# Copy this file to .github/workflows/sdlc-pr-fix.yml in your repository
# This workflow fixes PR issues based on comment history when triggered.
#
# Triggers:
#   - When the "fix-issues" label is added to a PR
#   - Manually via workflow_dispatch
#
# The agent reads PR comments to understand what needs to be fixed,
# then commits changes directly to the PR branch.
#
# Required secrets:
#   - GH_TOKEN: GitHub Personal Access Token with repo scope
#   - LLM_API_TOKEN: Your LLM API key
